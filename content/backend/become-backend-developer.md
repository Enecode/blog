So you've decided that backend development is the career for you - congratulations! Many self-taught coders have a hard time deciding between all the various options, but it's *so much easier* to learn effectively if you have a clear goal, like backend work, in mind.

## What is a backend developer?

Backend developers are just one of many kinds of "programmer". Back-end developers build and maintain the systems that store, process, and secure the data used by websites and apps. This is in contrast to front-end developers, who control everything you *see and interact with directly* in your browser or on a mobile app. Backend developers concern themselves with [servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model), while front-end developers work on clients.

Some of the most common job titles for programmers include:

* Front-end developer
* Back-end developer
* Mobile developer
* Game developer
* DevOps specialist
* Data Scientist

According to Stack Overflow's last [developer survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#salary-united-states), backend developers in the US tie for the highest median salary of this group: **$150,000**. If you enjoy working on problems that involve algorithms, data structures, natural language processing, databases, or distributed systems, then backend development might be for you.

## Can I really learn backend by myself?

Many people assume that because backend developers typically need to have a better understanding of computer science fundamentals, that's it's harder to get an entry-level backend position, and as a result, they start educating themselves on front-end technologies. **I think this is a mistake.**

Just because CS *skills* are often a requirement for backend positions, it's almost never the case that a CS *degree* is required. If you take the learning path I outline below, there's no need to go back to university.

## How do I become a backend developer?

Follow these steps in order - there are plenty of places you can learn backend online effectively, some of the resources are paid, some are free.

### 1. Learn basic coding skills

Learning simple coding syntax in is actually super fun and you can get up and running immediately. Your goal should be to understand the basic syntax of **one or two** programming languages. JavaScript and Python are great choices. You should be learning simple concepts like:

* Variables and data
* Comparison operators
* Loops
* Functions
* Arrays

#### Resources to learn basic coding skills

* [Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/lessons)
* [FreeCodeCamp's Learn JS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-javascript-full-course/)

### 2. Learn how apps use backend servers

Your goal here is to understand *why* we need backend developers at all! I'd recommend actually doing a couple small, simple front-end projects so that you can understand the role a backend server plays in an application.

### Resources

* [HTML5 Canvas Graphics](https://boot.dev/learn/learn-graphics-html5-canvas)
* [Learn HTTP](https://boot.dev/learn/learn-http)
* [FreeCodeCamp's Learn HTTP](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/http-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-it/)
* [HTML and CSS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/html-css-11-hour-course/)

### 3. Master data structures & algorithms

This step might take a bit longer - your goal here should be to [learn computer science fundamentals](/computer-science/comprehensive-guide-to-learn-computer-science-online/). Go deep on some of the most common algorithms and data structures concepts. Backend interviews are often full of questions on this topic. As a backend developer, it will be your job to make sure that the companies servers are running code that's fast and performant.
