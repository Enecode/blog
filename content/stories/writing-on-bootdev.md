We've just opened up the [Boot.dev Blog](/) to public contributions! We're really excited to see all the great stories that our readers and students will create.

## What kinds of articles will you publish?

[Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) is a platform for anyone interested in learning to code, particularly backend development in Python, JavaScript, and Go. As far as the stories we'll publish, we accept *well-written articles that are at least somewhat related to programming*.

## Why should I write on Boot.dev?

By writing and publishing your ideas publicly, you can:

* Impress future employers
* Help you solidify what you've recently learned
* Help others find answers that took you a long time to research
* Gain traffic and domain authority for your own blogs and projects
* Get helpful feedback on your writing skills from our editorial team

## How do I contribute?

It's totally free to contribute articles to Boot.dev, and you're even allowed to drop *tasteful* `dofollow` links back to your own projects and sites. Take advantage of our great domain authority and reach! As long as your article is original and well-written we don't mind you getting some exposure to our readers.

## Your article must be original to Boot.dev.

We don't want to spam our readers with content that they've already seen elsewhere. Your article must be original to Boot.dev. That said, *after* your original piece is published on Boot.dev, you can republish it elsewhere *only if* you set the canonical link back to the Boot.dev article.
